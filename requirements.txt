ScarTrek has following requirements:
1. Python 2.7

2. The data should be in the following directory structure:
NOTE: Program SNPTB (https://github.com/aditi9783/SNPTB) generates required files in this directory structure

<projectname>
    |--<sample1>
    |      |--<mapped>
    |           |-<sample1>.aln.sorted.bam
    |           |-<sample1>.aln.sorted.bam.bai
    |           |-aln.sorted.bam.mpileup
    |           |-map.run
    |--<sample2>
    |      |--<mapped>
    |           |-<sample2>.aln.sorted.bam
    |           |-<sample2>.aln.sorted.bam.bai
    |           |-aln.sorted.bam.mpileup
    |           |-map.run
    |
    ...

* map.run is generated by bowtie2/2.2.6 and is used to filter samples based on % of reads mapped to reference
* .bam file is generated by bowtie2/2.2.6
* .bai and .mpileup files are generated by samtools/1.2
Please note that files generated by other software or other versions of above software are not tested with ScarTrek.

2. To use the MAPQ filter (filter indel positions based on average read mapping quality at the site, default threshold is 10), Samtools (version 1.2) must be loaded in the environment and .bam and .bai files should be present in the appropriate path as per directory structure in point 2. If user desires to not use this filter, or is Samtools is not available to use this filter, then setting this parameter to 0 ignores this parameter. For example:
"$python find_scars.py -i ../example/ -q 0"
The above command runs ScarTrek on the example data while ignoring the MAPQ filter.
